# Summary
### In this codelab, you added a Fragment to the AndroidTrivia app, which you will keep working on in the next two codelabs in this lesson.

# > A Fragment is a modular section of an activity.
# > A Fragment has its own lifecycle and receives its own input events.
# > Use the <fragment> tag to define the layout for the Fragment in the XML layout file.
# > Inflate the layout for a Fragment in onCreateView().
# > You can add or remove a Fragment while the activity is running.
