# Summary
### The following features may be different in Kotlin than what you're used to in other languages:
> Kotlin types can't be implicitly converted—use casting.

> Variables declared with val can only be assigned once.

> Kotlin variables are not nullable by default. Use ? to make variables nullable.

> With Kotlin, you can loop through the index and elements of an array at the same time in a for loop.

### The following Kotlin programming constructs are similar to those in other languages:
> Arrays and lists can have a single type or mixed types.

> Arrays and lists can be nested.

> You can create loops with for, while, do/while, and repeat.

> The when statement is Kotlin's version of the switch statement, but when is more flexible.


### Answer these questions

Which of the following declares an unchangeable list of strings?
>> ▢ val school = arrayOf("shark", "salmon", "minnow")

>> ▢ var school = arrayOf("shark", "salmon", "minnow")

>> /▢ val school = listOf("shark", "salmon", "minnow")

>> ▢ val school = mutableListOf("shark", "salmon", "minnow")

What will be the output of the following code? for (i in 3..8 step 2) print(i)
>> ▢ 345678

>> ▢ 468

>> ▢ 38

>>  /▢ 357

What is the purpose of the question mark in this code? var rocks: Int? = 3
>> ▢ The type of the variable rocks isn't fixed.

>> /▢ The variable rocks can be set to null.

>> ▢ The variable rocks cannot be set to null.

>> ▢ The variable rocks shouldn't be initialized right away.
