# Summary
> Kotlin is similar to other object-oriented programming languages.
> Install the latest JDK for your operating system to use Kotlin.
> Install the IntelliJ IDEA to work with Kotlin.

### The following features may be different in Kotlin than what you're used to in other languages:
> Kotlin types can't be implicitly convertedâ€”use casting.

> Variables declared with val can only be assigned once.

> Kotlin variables are not nullable by default. Use ? to make variables nullable.

> With Kotlin, you can loop through the index and elements of an array at the same time in a for loop.

### The following Kotlin programming constructs are similar to those in other languages:
> Arrays and lists can have a single type or mixed types.

> Arrays and lists can be nested.

> You can create loops with for, while, do/while, and repeat.

> The when statement is Kotlin's version of the switch statement, but when is more flexible.
